Simulation of decentralized inverter-based AC microgrid with P-f and Q-V droop control.
Droop originates from the principle of power balance in synchronous generators. An imbalance between the input mechanical power and the output electric power causes a change in the rotor speed and electrical frequency. Similarly, variation in output reactive power results in voltage magnitude deviation.
Such a characteristic can be artificially created for electronically interfaced inverter-based AC microgrid. In droop control, the relationships between real power and frequency and reactive power and voltage are as follows:
𝜔𝑟𝑒𝑓= 𝜔𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙−𝑚𝑝∗𝑃
𝑣𝑟𝑒𝑓= 𝑣𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙−𝑛𝑞∗𝑄
